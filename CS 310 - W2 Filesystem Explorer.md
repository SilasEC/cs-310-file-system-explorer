# CS 310: Week 2 - File System Explorer

## Report

For bash scripts:
1. How do you accept command-line arguments?

  In bash, command line arguments are automatically assigned to variables name $0, $1, etc. So, in the script all you need to do is name those variables to access the arguments.
  
 2.  What other programs did you use to complete this assignment? (I mean things like `cat`, `sed`, etc. Not AI)

   I used stat to get the file size, file to get the mime file type, and echo to print output in terminal.
